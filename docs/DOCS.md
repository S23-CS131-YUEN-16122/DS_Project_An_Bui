Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation
 
This program implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from
a source vertex to all other vertices in a given graph represented by an
adjacency matrix.
 
The graph is represented by a 2D array `graph` with VERTICES number of vertices.
The `dijkstra` function calculates the shortest path from a specified source
vertex to all other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.
