/********************************************************************************
 * Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation
 *
 * This program implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from
 * a source vertex to all other vertices in a given graph represented by an
 * adjacency matrix.
 *
 * The graph is represented by a 2D array `graph` with VERTICES number of vertices.
 * The `dijkstra` function calculates the shortest path from a specified source
 * vertex to all other vertices using Dijkstra's algorithm.
